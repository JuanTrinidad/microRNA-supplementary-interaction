# microRNA-supplementary-interaction
Welcome to our github! In this proyect you will find the scripts used in the article [Transcriptome-wide analysis of microRNA-mRNA correlations in unperturbed tissue transcriptomes identifies microRNA targeting determinants](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.22.473932v1.full.pdf) and Windows executable programs to perform customized searches of supplementary-interactions sites.

## Executables 
If you are interested in search for microRNA-mRNA-interaction comprising seeds of 6mer or longer and supplementary-interaction sites you can use our programs.
Interaction are predicted based on perfect base paring. You will find the information needed to run the programs in the 'executables' folder (Read Me PDF).

## Article scripts
The scripts used in the article are available in this folder. Scripts are numerated following the order of the analysis.
